# Overview

The goal of Gobbler is to be a simple and fast message bus for user interaction and replication of data between multiple devices:
* Very easy consumption of messages with web and mobile clients
* Fast realtime messaging, as well as playback of messages from a persistent commit log
* Reliable and scalable over multiple nodes
* User-aware semantics to easily support messaging scenarios between people using multiple devices
* Batteries included: usable as front-facing server, without the need of a proxy layer
* Self-contained: no mandatory dependencies to other services

## Working Features (release 0.5)

* Publishing and subscription of messages to topics and subtopics
* Persistent message store with transparent live and offline fetching
* WebSocket API for message publishing
* REST APIs for message publishing
* Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) connector: delivery of messages as FCM push notifications
* Support for Apple Push Notification services (APNS)
* Support for SMS-sending (using Nexmo as a first provider / implementation)
* Commandline client and Go client library
* Docker images for server and client
* Logging using [logrus](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus) and logstash formatter
* Health-Check with Endpoint
* Prometheus metrics
* PostgreSQL as KV Backend
* Cluster-mode (can be disabled at compile-time)
* Load testing with 5000 messages per instance
* Unified handling of APNS and Firebase push-notifications and subscriptions under a common API
* GET list of subscribers / list of topics per subscriber (userID , deviceID) 
* Filtering of messages in gobbler server (e.g. sent by the REST client) according to URL parameters: UserID, DeviceID, Connector name
* Reporting individual events (sent push-notifications / subscriptions / sent sms) using Kafka
* Feature-toggle endpoint for disabling/enabling push-notification and SMS connectors at runtime
* Using `glide` for vendoring / dependency management 

## Throughput
Measured on an old notebook with i5-2520M, dual core and SSD.
Message payload was 'Hello Word'.
Load driver and server were set up on the same machine, so 50% of the cpu was allocated to the load driver.

* End-2-End: Delivery of ~35.000 persistent messages per second
* Fetching: Receive of ~70.000 persistent messages per second

During the tests, the memory consumption of the server was around ~25 MB.

# Gobbler Docker Image
We are providing Docker images of the server and client for your convenience.

## Start the Gobbler Server
There is an automated Docker build for the master branch at Docker Hub.
To start the server with Docker simply type:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 cosminrentea/gobbler
```

To see available configuration options:
```
docker run cosminrentea/gobbler --help
```

All options can be supplied on the commandline or by a corresponding environment variable with the prefix `GUBLE_`.
So to let `gobbler` be more verbose, you can either use:
```
docker run cosminrentea/gobbler --log=info
```
or
```
docker run -e GUBLE_LOG=info cosminrentea/gobbler
```

The Docker image has a volume mount point at `/var/lib/gobbler`, so if you want to bind-mount the persistent storage from your host you should use:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /host/storage/path:/var/lib/gobbler cosminrentea/gobbler
```

## Connecting with the Gobbler Client
The Docker image includes the gobbler commandline client `gobbler-cli`.
You can execute it within a running gobbler container and connect to the server:
```
docker run -d --name gobbler cosminrentea/gobbler
docker exec -it gobbler /usr/local/bin/gobbler-cli
```
Visit the [`guble-cli` documentation](https://github.com/cosminrentea/gobbler/tree/master/guble-cli) for more details.

# Build and Run
Since Go makes it very easy to build from source, you can compile gobbler using a single command.
A prerequisite is having an installed Go environment and an empty directory:
```
sudo apt-get install golang
mkdir gobbler && cd gobbler
export GOPATH=`pwd`
```

## Build and Start the Server
Build and start gobbler with the following commands (assuming that directory `/var/lib/gobbler` is already created with read-write rights for the current user):
```
go get github.com/cosminrentea/gobbler
bin/gobbler --log=info
```

## Run All Tests
```
go get -t github.com/cosminrentea/gobbler/...
go test github.com/cosminrentea/gobbler/...
```

# Clients
The following clients are available:
* __Commandline Client__: https://github.com/cosminrentea/gobbler/tree/master/gobbler-cli
* __Go client library__: https://github.com/cosminrentea/gobbler/tree/master/client

# Protocol Reference

## REST API
Currently there is a minimalistic REST API, just for publishing messages.

```
POST /api/message/<topic>
```
URL parameters:
* __userId__: The PublisherUserId
* __messageId__: The PublisherMessageId

### Headers
You can set fields in the header JSON of the message by providing the corresponding HTTP headers with the prefix `X-Gobbler-`.

Curl example with the resulting message:
```
curl -X POST -H "x-Gobbler-Key: Value" --data Hello 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/message/foo?userId=marvin&messageId=42'
```
results in:
```
16,/foo,marvin,VoAdxGO3DBEn8vv8,42,1451236804
{"Key":"Value"}
Hello
```

## WebSocket Protocol
The communication with the gobbler server is done by ordinary WebSockets, using a binary encoding.

### Message Format
All payload messages sent from the server to the client are using the following format:
```
<path:string>,<sequenceId:int64>,<publisherUserId:string>,<publisherApplicationId:string>,<publisherMessageId:string>,<messagePublishingTime:unix-timestamp>\n
[<application headers json>]\n
<body>

example 1:
/foo/bar,42,user01,phone1,id123,1420110000
{"Content-Type": "text/plain", "Correlation-Id": "7sdks723ksgqn"}
Hello World

example 2:
/foo/bar,42,user01,54sdcj8sd7,id123,1420110000

anyByteData
```

* All text formats are assumed to be UTF-8 encoded.
* Message `sequenceId`s are `int64`, and distinct within a topic.
  The message `sequenceId`s are strictly monotonically increasing depending on the message age, but there is no guarantee for the right order while transmitting.

### Client Commands
The client can send the following commands.

#### Send
Publish a message to a topic:
```
> <path> [<publisherMessageId>]\n
[<header>\n]..
\n
<body>

example:
> /foo

Hello World
```

#### Subscribe/Receive
Receive messages from a path (e.g. a topic or subtopic).
This command can be used to subscribe for incoming messages on a topic,
as well as for replaying the message history.
```
+ <path> [<startId>[,<maxCount>]]
```
* `path`: the topic to receive the messages from
* `startId`: the message id to start the replay
** If no `startId` is given, only future messages will be received (simple subscribe).
** If the `startId` is negative, it is interpreted as relative count of last messages in the history.
* `maxCount`: the maximum number of messages to replay

__Note__: Currently, the fetching of stored messages does not recognize subtopics.

Examples:
```
+ /foo         # Subscribe to all future messages matching /foo
+ /foo/bar     # Subscribe to all future messages matching /foo/bar

+ /foo 0       # Receive all message from the topic and subscribe for further incoming messages.

+ /foo 42      # Receive all message with message ids >= 42
               # from the topic and subscribe for further incoming messages.

+ /foo 0 20    # Receive the first (oldest) 20 messages within the topic and stop.
               # (If the topic has less messages, it will stop after receiving all existing ones.)

+ /foo -20     # Receive the last (newest) 20 messages from the topic and then
               # subscribe for further incoming messages.

+ /foo -20 20  # Receive the last (newest) 20 messages within the topic and stop.
               # (If the topic has less messages, it will stop after receiving all existing ones.)
```

#### Unsubscribe/Cancel
Cancel further receiving of messages from a path (e.g. a topic or subtopic).

```
- <path>

example:
- /foo
- /foo/bar
```

### Server Status Messages
The server sends status messages to the client. All positive status messages start with `>`.
Status messages reporting an error start with `!`. Status messages are in the following format.

```
'#'<msgType> <Explanation text>\n
<json data>
```

#### Connection Message
```
#ok-connected You are connected to the server.\n
{"ApplicationId": "the app id", "UserId": "the user id", "Time": "the server time as unix timestamp "}
```

Example:
```
#connected You are connected to the server.
{"ApplicationId": "phone1", "UserId": "user01", "Time": "1420110000"}
```

#### Send Success Notification
This notification confirms, that the messaging system has successfully received the message and now starts transmitting it to the subscribers:

```
#send <publisherMessageId>
{"sequenceId": "sequence id", "path": "/foo", "publisherMessageId": "publishers message id", "messagePublishingTime": "unix-timestamp"}
```

#### Receive Success Notification
Depending on the type of `+` (receive) command, up to three different notification messages will be sent back.
Be aware, that a server may send more receive notifications that you would have expected in first place, e.g. when:
* Additional messages are stored, while the first fetching is in progress
* The server decides to meanwhile stop the online subscription and change to fetching,
  because your client is too slow to read all incoming messages.

1. When the fetch operation starts:

    ```
    #fetch-start <path> <count>
    ```
    * `path`: the topic path
    * `count`: the number of messages that will be returned

2. When the fetch operation is done:

    ```
    #fetch-done <path>
    ```
    * `path`: the topic path

3. When the subscription to new messages was taken:

    ```
    #subscribed-to <path>
    ```
    * `path`: the topic path

#### Unsubscribe Success Notification
An unsubscribe/cancel operation is confirmed by the following notification:
```
#canceled <path>
```

#### Send Error Notification
This message indicates, that the message could not be delivered.
```
!error-send <publisherMessageId> <error text>
{"sequenceId": "sequence id", "path": "/foo", "publisherMessageId": "publishers message id", "messagePublishingTime": "unix-timestamp"}
```

#### Bad Request
This notification has the same meaning as the http 400 Bad Request.
```
!error-bad-request unknown command 'sdcsd'
```

#### Internal Server Error
This notification has the same meaning as the http 500 Internal Server Error.
```
!error-server-internal this computing node has problems
```

## Topics

Messages can be hierarchically routed by topics, so they are represented by a path, separated by `/`.
The server takes care, that a message only gets delivered once, even if it is matched by multiple
subscription paths.

### Subtopics
The path delimiter gives the semantic of subtopics. 
With this, a subscription to a parent topic (e.g. `/foo`)
also results in receiving all messages of the subtopics (e.g. `/foo/bar`).
